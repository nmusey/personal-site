# Personal Site

This is a personal site and blog to showcase some of my past work. It's created using nextjs.

## Running the site locally
`git clone https://github.com/nmusey/personal-site.git` to clone the site to your local machine.

`pnpm dev` or `npm run dev` to run the server, and open the page on your [localhost](http://localhost:3000).

Blog posts and projects can be edited in the `data` directory of the project. Ensure frontmatter is correctly inserted, see other posts for examples of what the frontmatter should look like.

Nextjs documentation can be found [here](https://nextjs.org/docs) for how to develop using nextjs.
