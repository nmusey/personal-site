# Personal Site

This is a personal site to showcase some of my past work. It's created using nextjs.

## Running the site locally
`git clone https://github.com/nmusey/personal-site.git` to clone the site to your local machine.

`pnpm dev` or `npm run dev` to run the server, and open the page on your [localhost](http://localhost:3000).

Blog posts and projects can be edited in the `data` directory of the project. Be sure to add an entry into the JSON file as well so the post shows up. Use existing entries to see what information is needed.

Nextjs documentation can be found [here](https://nextjs.org/docs) for how to develop using nextjs.
